Our shell allows executing the following commands:

- cd <new-directory>: changes the current directory to the directory specified in its argument.
- exit: terminates the program with state 0 (exit-success).
- #: starts a comment until the end of the current line.
- execvp(): executes the commands corresponding to this C function (ls, pwd, grep, etc.).

Each entered command must be separated by spaces from its argument and/or the next command.

The implementation of these functionalities is in the built-in() method, which runs after the input is tokenized. Each simple function is processed in this method, which returns 0 if there are no errors and 1 if the command is not found or there was an execution failure.

Our shell also allows executing the following operators:

- <argument> (> ,< , >>) <argument>: redirects standard input and output (this is the operator with the lowest priority of all and is executed along with simple commands).
- <argument> | <argument>: redirects the standard output of the first command to the input of the second.
